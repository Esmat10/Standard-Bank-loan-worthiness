Standard Bank Data Science Virtual Experience Programme 
# Project Overview
The bank aims to improve the current process in which potential borrowers apply for a home loan. The current process involves loan officers having to manually process home loan applications. This process takes 2 to 3 days to process upon which the applicant will receive communication on whether or not they have been granted the loan for the requested amount. To improve the process Standard Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the credit worthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that the applicant receives a response immediately after completing application.
